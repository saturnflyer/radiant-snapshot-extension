= Snapshot

Create a snapshot of all pages on your site.

This was based upon an old Snapshot extension from long 
ago by a developer whom I can't remember as well as the
[Electrostatic Extension](http://ext.radiantcms.org/extensions/144-electrostatic)
by Justin Knowlden.

Currently, it copies all it's files to a directory in tmp/
and sends you a zip file. The Electrostatic Extension 
creates a `tar` file, but I wanted this to bit a bit more
friendly to the non-tech-savvy. I'm not sure if my
assumption is correct, but I suspect some users to be
confused by that extension on a file. However, the `.zip`
isn't working properly, so that'll be addressed in the future.
Contributions are welcome.
